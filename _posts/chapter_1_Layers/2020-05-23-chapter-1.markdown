Layering is the most important concept in all of the Networks. Layers add modularity  and help to manage
the complexity of networks. Even the most trivial task such as clicking on a webpage and getting results involves
a large number of operations in the background.


Some of the operations are that happen in the background are:
- Making and breaking of connections. 
- Finding paths through a network
- Sharing bandwidth with multiple users
- Encryption of data 
- Finding alternate routes
- Ensuring the reliability of data sent

These operations are just tip of the iceberg and all these operations happen just for a click of a button
what we need is, therefore, is a sense of modularity that will help us reuse many of the network functionality for 
different settings,
this is achieved through `protocols` and `layering`.

Before we go any further its best that we see the full layer of Internet.
